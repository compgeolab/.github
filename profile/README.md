The **CompGeoLab** is a research group based at the
[University of Liverpool](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/earth-ocean-and-ecological-sciences/).
We are experts in solving **inverse problems** in the field of **Geophysics**.
For example, determining the inner density distribution of the Earth from
measured disturbances in the Earth's gravity field. These are the main tools
used by geoscientists to **image the inside** of the Earth and other planets.

We also specialize in building **open-source scientific software**. Our team
works on several tools and projects, both developing tools in-house and
contributing across the larger scientific ecosystem.
