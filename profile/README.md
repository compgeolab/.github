<h2>Welcome to the CompGeoLab <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/compgeolab/logo/main/favicon.png" height="22px"></h2>
  
We're a research group focused on solving **inverse problems** in **Geophysics** 
and building **open-source scientific software**.
  
These are the main tools used by geoscientists to **image the inside** of the Earth and other planets.
Our team works on several open tools and projects, both developed in-house and across the larger scientific ecosystem.
